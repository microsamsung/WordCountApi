This is the assignment:

Word Count API
Description
Requirements
API:
Create an API with a single endpoint “POST /api/wordcount”
Wordcount should allow the user to upload a text file. The API should then perform the word count operation and return the result to the user
Word count operation:
Count the number of occurrences for each word in the file. (You can use if you need an example file https://www.lipsum.com/)
Words are case insensitive.
A word can be defined as a set of alpha numeric characters surrounded by white-space
The result of the count operation should be the number of occurrences of each word in the file ordered by most occurrences to least

Please keep in mind concepts like maintainability, testability and the possibility of extending the API
If you have any questions or concerns or just want some inspiration please contact me.
Please also let me know if you would like to schedule a separate Teams call to deep dive into what Danske Bank is doing and also the composition and reponsibilities of the squad you would be joining.
